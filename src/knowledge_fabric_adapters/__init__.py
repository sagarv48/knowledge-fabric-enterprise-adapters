"""
knowledge-fabric-adapters — public adapter contracts for the knowledge-fabric ecosystem.

This package contains the Protocol interfaces, data models, and base classes
needed to write custom source and runtime adapters that integrate with
knowledge-fabric and intent-fabric.

The private ``enterprise-adapters`` package contains production implementations
(Confluence, SharePoint, ServiceNow, etc.) that depend on these contracts.
Community-written adapters should depend on this package instead.

Installation:
    pip install knowledge-fabric-adapters

Quick-start for adapter authors:
    from knowledge_fabric_adapters import KnowledgeSourceAdapter, ReadOnlyResource, AdapterContext
